# cryptopals

My attempts at solving the [Cryptopals][1] challenges, mainly in [Rust][2].

Some rough scratch Jupyter notebooks can be found in the `notebooks` directory, but otherwise everything here is a Rust crate.

The solutions to the challenges themselves are implemented as tests in the `challenges` crate.
